Advent of Code 2024 in R

Did it mostly in Rust last year, expecting a much easier time this year. Maybe I should give Haskell a go. The template might be useful if you're also doing AoC in R, the `make_new` script might be useful for anyone.

# TODO:

-   [ ] Add calendar day detection to `make_new`
-   [ ] Cronjob to download the input and instructions automatically (lol)
