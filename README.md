Advent of Code 2024 in R

Did it mostly in Rust last year, expecting a much easier time this year. Maybe I should give Haskell a go. The template and `init.R` might be useful if you're also doing AoC in R, the `make_new` and `all_done` scripts might be useful for anyone.

Scripts are zsh and assume you're on MacOS with Rstudio and Chromium installed.


## TODO:

-   [ ] Add calendar day detection to `make_new`
-   [ ] Cronjob to download the input and instructions automatically (lol)
-   [ ] Validate day number input in make_new
